        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, my name is Matthew Rah, and Iâ€™m currently an English major at the University of Riverside, California. As a freshman navigating my first quarter, Iâ€™ve encountered both excitement and challenges, but Iâ€™m committed to overcoming them and embracing this transformative journey.  <br><br>

        From a young age, Iâ€™ve been captivated by the world of books, particularly fiction. The diverse stories Iâ€™ve immersed myself inâ€”from classic literature to contemporary novelsâ€”have not only entertained me but also profoundly shaped my perspective on life and the human experience. Each narrative Iâ€™ve explored has introduced me to a variety of voices and cultures, fueling my desire to become a writer myself. This passion for storytelling has guided me toward my goal of becoming an English teacher, where I can inspire others to find their own voices and pursue their literary dreams.

Attending the University of Riverside is a pivotal step toward realizing my ambitions. The campus environment is vibrant and stimulating, filled with opportunities to connect with fellow students and faculty who share my interests. Iâ€™ve already begun to forge relationships with peers who are equally passionate about literature and writing. These connections are invaluable, as they not only provide support but also foster creative collaboration, which I believe is essential for growth as a writer.

In my courses, Iâ€™ve been engaged in discussions that delve deep into the works of various authors. Analyzing their writing styles, themes, and character development has broadened my understanding of literature and sharpened my analytical skills. This has also encouraged me to reflect on my own writing, pushing me to experiment with different techniques and genres. I find that engaging with the works of established authors challenges me to raise my own standards and strive for excellence in my craft.<br><br>

        Recently, I accomplished a significant milestone by completing a draft of a story that I plan to submit at the end of this term. This project has been an eye-opening experience, allowing me to identify both my strengths and areas for improvement as a writer. The process of drafting, revising, and seeking feedback from peers has been incredibly valuable. It has taught me the importance of perseverance and adaptability, qualities that are crucial not only in writing but also in life.

Moreover, I am learning the importance of constructive criticism and how it can serve as a catalyst for improvement. Sharing my work with others and receiving feedback has helped me develop a more objective perspective on my writing. Iâ€™ve come to understand that writing is a process, one that requires patience and dedication. Each draft, each revision, brings me closer to honing my skills and finding my unique voice as a writer.

As I continue my journey at the University of Riverside, I am eager to take full advantage of the resources available to me, including writing workshops, literary events, and mentorship opportunities. I believe that by immersing myself in this vibrant academic community, I will not only enhance my writing abilities but also cultivate the knowledge and experience necessary to inspire others as an educator. My goal is to foster a love for literature in my future students, encouraging them to explore their creativity and embrace the power of storytelling. I am excited about the path ahead and look forward to all the growth and learning that awaits me in the coming years.
